You can write a job ad that doesn’t sound like a robot or a zombie wrote it. You can put a human voice in your job ads, and you’ll get a much better response when you do! Start by telling us about the organization. Don’t use boring business boilerplate language like “We are a leading software firm.” That isn’t going to make anyone’s heart beat faster. Tell us the story of your organization, and why anyone would want to work there.

Next, tell us about the role that’s available. Why is the job open? Where did the job come from – how did the need emerge? We want to know the details. That makes the job more interesting to candidates. We need to know **why** to apply more than **how** to apply! You are competing with every other employer in your area. You have to entice candidates, or they’ll skip your job ad and go to the next one.

Here’s a sample job ad. Notice that our job ad is written in the voice of one person — the hiring manager. Do you think the hiring manager, Allan, is taking a chance by putting his name and email address in the ad? Allan isn’t worried about that, because it’s going to be very easy for Allan to screen the responses he receives. He’s going to be able to make a very quick decision as he looks at each response for a minute or two.

That’s because Allan included a Logical Gate in the job ad. We teach managers and HR folks how to write job ads, including Logical Gates, in our programs. The Logical Gate makes it very easy for Allan to screen the responses to his job ad. He can tell right away how well each candidate understands his need — the reason he’s looking to hire someone — just by reading the candidate’s response to Allan’s job ad.

**OPERATIONS MANAGER: YOUR EXPERTISE IS NEEDED! **

*Our company, Acme Explosives, was founded in 1943 by our CEO’s grandfather. We’re a $50M company now and the largest stick-dynamite maker in the USA. We’re growing, and we’ve created an Operations Manager position reporting to me, the Director of Operations, Allan Smith.*

*I look after Operations, Purchasing, Production and Inventory Control, and in this role you’ll work closely with the managers of all those departments along with the whole crew at Acme.* *You’ll be responsible for our facilities (a 30,000 sf office and 200,000 sf manufacturing/warehouse facility on the same campus) and for Safety and Security for our organization.*

*You’ll work closely with our HR team on employee safety and security issues and make sure that our facility is safe, comfortable, energy-efficient and operationally in shape to power our growth.* *The challenge in this job will be keeping our Operations functions up to speed with of our growth and keeping up with the constant changes in this growing business. The reward will be the ability to run your own Operations shop, working with sharp, ethical and dedicated people who believe in our company, our opportunity and one another.*

*The compensation range for this role is $85-$90K.* *If you’re interested in learning more, please write to me at allansmith@acmeexplosives.com with a 300-word reply. In your letter, let me know why this job is a great fit for you, not only in terms of your qualifications  but also by answering the question “How will this opportunity advance your career?” Lastly, in your letter tell me what you’d view as the major areas of priority for you in this job and where you’d expect to find issues that we need to jump on immediately. Thanks for reading, and enjoy your day!* What did you notice about Allan’s job ad?

-   There aren’t any Requirements or Essential Qualifications. How would Allan know the exact background that his perfect candidate will have? He doesn’t know. His new hire could come from any number of different backgrounds. The new Operations Manager could have a military or law-enforcement background. He or she could have a facilities background or a safety background. The right person will emerge from the group of folks who respond to Allan’s ad. He isn’t going to create artificial obstacles for himself by specifying the requirements the new hire must have!

-   There isn’t any stupid boring corporatespeak language. Allan talks directly to the person reading the ad, one person at a time, the same way we teach job-seekers to write directly to hiring managers in their [Pain Letters.](http://www.humanworkplace.com/whats-pain-letter/)

-   Allan includes a Logical Gate in his job ad. He asks interested candidates to send him a 300-word reply, and he tells them what should be in the reply. The best candidates are going to be obvious immediately when Allan reads the replies. Most candidates, sadly, will ignore the Logical Gate requirement and send a standard resume (with or without cover letter) to Allan in their haste to respond to the ad. Those people will get polite No Thanks letters.

    Excellent article! It’s a much better way to assess the capabilities of the candidate and get out of the ‘black hole.’

    BRAVO! Great example. Next step, sending it out to all 11 hospital conglomerates, Oil & Gas firms, IT, etc. :~) I am sure they are onboard by now!

    Wonderful advice – thank you. .I couldn’t agree more – Recruiters and HR take note.. so refreshing. BUT requires much discipline.

    Question: I like the ad, however we are an OFCCP federal contractor and have specifications given to us on what language (essential functions) to include in our job postings. How can we include your ad style and still be compliant?
