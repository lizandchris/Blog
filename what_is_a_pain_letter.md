****** What’s_a_Pain_Letter?_ ******
August 28, 2014/53_Comments/in Human_workplace /by Liz_Ryan
A Â Pain Letter is the 21st-century answer to a cover letter. A Pain Letter is
a lot more specific than a traditional cover letter is. A Pain Letter talks to
your Â hiring manager — the person it was written for, individually — about his
or her Business Pain. If there were no pain, there wouldn’t be a job opening!
You can send a Pain Letter to any hiring manager. You can find him or her on
LinkedIn, the employer’s own website or even Google. You’ll send your Pain
Letter directly to the hiring manager’s desk the old-fashioned way, through the
mail, stapled to your Human-Voiced Resume. Your HVR will be one or two pages
long and your Pain Letter is one page long, so the whole Pain Packet will be
two to three pages long.
It’s easy to write a Pain Letter. There are four parts to a Pain Letter: the
Hook, the Pain Hypothesis, the Dragon-Slaying Story and the Closing.
Here’s a sample Pain Letter:
Dear Margaret,
Congratulations to you and the team at Acme Explosives on winning SoCal
Business’s Fastest-Growing Companies award! That’s a feather in your cap, and
tremendous affirmation from the marketplace. (That’s the hook – short and
sweet.)
I can only imagine that given Acme’s rate of growth, your Marketing team is
right up against the wall. (There’s your Pain Hypothesis!)
When I ran Marketing projects for Angry Chocolates during its run-up from $10M
to $45M in sales, just before its acquisition by Nestle, we were in a similar
spot. We had to keep our loyal domestic customers happy while launching an
international sales effort and an ecommerce business at the same time. We made
it work somehow and grew sales from $10M to $27M in one year. (Heck yes you
did! That’s your Dragon-Slaying Story. It shows how you’ve solved a similar
Business Pain in the past.)Â 
If you’ve got a need for marketing project management and a minute to chat I’d
love to learn more about Acme and share a bit of my story with you. (That’s
your Closing. See how easy that was?)
Best,
Phil Brooks

Black Hole recruiting portals and reaching their hiring managers directly — and
of course by using their networks, LinkedIn and other new-millennium job-search
techniques.

      This reminds me of my son’s admission letter to his college, in which he
      depicted himself as a partier choosing the school for that reason, though
      with a distinctly tongue-in-cheek tone. He got in. I’m not sure how often
      your approach works, but it’s certainly more fun than the alternative.
      The only problem I have is that, in my experience, “Hiring Manager” is
      not a job title found very often on LinkiedIn. One sees lots of HR
      positions, but it’s impossible to know which of them actually does the
      hiring. Any suggestions? Thanks for the entertainment.

            Good point, Gerry. I rarely find a job posting stating the actual
            hiring manager.
            I like the idea of a Pain Letter though!

            You can typically find out more about who the hiring manager is on
            the company website. When you cross reference it on LinkedIn, you
            can see what they do specifically in their profile. LinkedIn offers
            a free month of premium membership (once every 12 months) and you
            have access to send up to 25 in mails a month, and the recruiter
            version of premium allows you to attach documents within the in
            mail. I highly recommend it.

            “Hiring Manager” is not a job title and not a person in HR – it
            refers to the manager who is hiring for the specific position and
            who the position would generally report to. So for a Marketing
            Assistant, the hiring manager would be the Marketing Manager. For a
            Financial Analyst, the hiring manager would be the VP of Finance.
            And so on.

      Gerry,
      Just to clarify, “hiring manager” relates to the person actually making
      the decision. I’ve been in the HR world for most of my career, and
      frankly have yet to see HR actually make a hiring decision (unless it is
      a role specifically related to an HR function). In terms of job
      searching, in most organizations they are the black hole whose function
      is to find a reason why they should immediately disqualify you before you
      talk to the decision maker (aka hiring manager). The gap between routine
      check boxes which “qualify” a candidate and domain knowledge of the role
      and business need is why so many really good candidates get overlooked.
      Those candidates that are overlooked are not even seen by the hiring
      manager. The hiring manager receives a select few resumes/candidates only
      to choose from. Still, certainly finding the decision maker is not always
      clear cut. Sometimes the job description will mention it, other times
      you’ll have to go with the highest person in that job function as your
      best guess.

            Good points– I worked in recruiting for some time as well, and have
            the same impression. HR people have a job requisition to fill, and
            typically feel applicants must meet every. single. point. on
            it…when the reality is there are some “must haves” and other things
            that would be “nice to have.”
            I love the idea of finding the person you’d want to work for at a
            company– so if you are looking for a Marketing Job, reach out to
            the Marketing Manager or Director of Marketing. Likewise–
            accounting people would approach Accounting Managers or the
            Director of Finance, perhaps even someone on the VP level.
            Approaching the person with the need directly should be a much more
            effective method of landing a job in today’s impersonal job market.

      I like the idea of writing Pain letters instead of Cover Letters. But, do
      you think that in my case, as a fresh graduate looking for the first job
      in HR (after 6 months of HR internship), I could use the same method?
      While I can spot the pain of the company/ hiring manager, I am aware that
      due to my short working experience the chances to be taken seriously
      about solving their problem are very low. Would you advise writing a pain
      letter in this case? and how should it be written then?
      Thanks!

      I read it, I loved it, I lived it. I sent my first Pain Letter. Who knows
      if I get the job, but that was so liberating! It put me on a par with
      them instead in suck up mode. Normally after a cover letter gets written,
      its wait and see and living on hope. I’m a trader, hope is not a
      strategy. In writing this letter, I gave them my best, they know who I
      am. When I interview they will already know me.
      I actually received an email from the president of the company the day he
      received it and follow up details from HR. That’s how it should work, the
      hiring manager telling HR who should be called.
      Thank You!

      Love it, did it and it works! I sent my first Pain Letter to a small
      company that I knew was hiring someone with my skills and experience–in
      this case it went directly to the Executive Director as the only other
      people listed on their website were clearly staff members and not HR
      folks. I agree with Steve, it was very liberating, and let the company
      know exactly what I could (and wanted) to do for them. I dashed the
      letter off in a half hour and mailed it on my lunch break from boring,
      clock-punching job. Within ten days I had an email from the ED stating,
      “Your CV landed on my desk last week at the same time that we were
      accepting applications for X position. Judging from your letter, I’m
      guessing that you were not actually applying for that position (it was
      posted but came down last week). The question is, would you be interested
      in the position?” And that was it, interview scheduled within two days.
      I’ll let you all know how it turns out!

      I wrote a pain letter for one of my friends and she got the job! Thank
      you! My letter:
      Congratulations on opening a store in the Northpark Mall. Although the
      expansion of xxx is exciting, it must be challenging to hire and train
      the staff in Dallas.
      When I was hired and trained as a member of the staff that opened the xxx
      store in Marlton, I learned the products and options so quickly that I
      became a reference for the other trainees. I am currently a FT sales
      associate in that store reporting to xx and xx.
      I would like to bring my tremendous product knowledge, strong operational
      abilities, and passion for selling to the new Dallas store. If this
      warrants a conversation, my contact details are on my resume.

      Liz, you are absolutely spot-on. It is always about the pain… In New
      Business Development, if you cannot quickly identify areas of business
      pain, then they WILL stay with the status quo. Tellin’ ain’t sellin; and
      just sending out your corporate brochure thinking that your prospect will
      actually read it (who cares about you??? first mistake), and then contact
      you saying “Yes, we need your services, please call us!” (second and
      fatal mistake), is totally misunderstanding the situation – without
      identifying their areas of business challenge, you are just giving a
      pitch.. and the only place a pitch belongs is in baseball.

      Perfect timing! I found myself in a rut this year with obtaining work. I
      have a natural talent for organizing people and product. I absolutely
      love working in merchandising. It allows me to travel to places I might
      have never seen. I meet new people. I have a great time and at the end of
      each project I can look at the work done and say “WOW! That looks so
      cool.” Unfortunately, I have been passed by and ignored this year. It is
      time to stir the pot so I can show off my talent in setting up new stores
      or doing remodels.
      I’ll use this and send you a picture as I leave on my first trip..

      Very much interested to this. I love all your articles Liz! But I have a
      question, how do you do pain letters for recruitment agents? You see,
      here in Sydney, almost all of the job ads are done by recruitment agents
      so you will not know immediately who is the hiring company. Also, most of
      these recruiters do not really say what is wrong in your resume even if I
      asked, they say everything is fine. That is why I’m having hard time to
      customized my resume for every job (i know i need to customize it because
      of the black hole system) because I know I already have my resume and
      profile to all of these recruiters. But I find all your articles very
      helpful so I think I will just have to try this first to direct employers
      (but it’s really very rare to find direct hiring nowadays, it’s like 5
      out of 50 job ads!). One more thing, I hope you can give an example for a
      finance/accounting role? Because most of the accounting roles are pretty
      much the same and the basic accounting processes and standards do not
      really varies, it’s hard to really make my resume and cover letter stand
      out and having a hard time to put something different that will convince
      the hiring manager to give me an interview. Like AR/AP roles, or
      financial reporting roles, the list of tasks that they put in the job ads
      are very much the same and all of my previous roles also have these tasks
      so even if I customize my resume I find it still the same with each
      other. I hope you can enlighten me on this.
      Thanks so much!

            I really the pain letter concept and am going to try it.
            Margie is right re the recruitment agents. You don’t know the firm
            behind the agent. I have got somewhere by calling the agent to
            discuss the role, that is working. You call the agent as though
            they are the hirer, be ready for an informal on the spot interview
            and I am getting the details then of the firm. I am using linked in
            (company research, networks) to then research the firm prior to
            interview.
            Some positions on seek don’t even list a recruitment agent and a
            number so there is no personal connection. I wonder – whether these
            are even worthwhile applying for – they’re so general, they must
            get 100’s of applications for these jobs.

      Seems useful to identify the uniqueness of job – hunter and establish the
      basic connection between one and the hiring company, which makes the job-
      hunter seems motiviated to solve the pains in the hiring company.

            Just wrote my 1st pain letter. See below. Hope it goes well!
            Congratulations to you and your team at Company X on the continued
            success and growth of your company. Iâm sure there is a lot of
            excitement in the air due to the recent expansion of your Mobile
            marketing division.
            I can only imagine that given Company X’s rate of growth, you and
            your team are right up against the wall.
            When I ran the Exterior services division for ABC Company during
            its territory expansion when our inventory grew over 500 properties
            in less than a weekâs time, we were in a similar spot. We had to
            continue to maintain our existing inventory while quickly hiring
            and training new employees to handle our new workload. We managed
            to make it through while still maintaining our above 90% rating on
            our inspections.
            I understand that you might be in need of an executive assistant
            that can also moonlight as a project coordinator. When I interned
            at 123 Inc., I did just that. I worked directly with the CEO
            providing any and all support that was needed. I went above and
            beyond the typical secretarial and administration duties that were
            at hand. I was given the opportunity to take on several special
            projects including recruitment, training, sales, event planning and
            obtaining media coverage for our clientele.
            I would love to bring my operations and communications experience
            alongside my passion of marketing to Company X. If this warrants a
            conversation, my contact details are on my resume.

      I am always used to write these to my potential employers, if I am
      heading for a position I’ll do some research on the company first and
      craft a letter for that certain position… nobody wants to read a generic
      uninterested yaddayadda of what you did at school.
      It does not only show poor interest, from the point of view of my
      employer it could be also unrespectful of their job. I am amazed if
      people didn’t figured it out yet.

      I like this idea. I have never been able to write a cover letter that I
      felt good about but the pain letter sounds much easier. Because your not
      asking for a job, your easing their pain, they might be more inclined to
      talk with you.

      Dear Liz,
      You are awesome! I cannot believe I actually got a reply to my pain
      letter within the shortest time from a CEO.
      At first, I had no clue what to write about. After conducting some
      research, It did work out. Thank you so much for this tip. Now I’m
      formally saying bye to cover letters!
      Regards,
      Raksha

      I’ve always done end runs– after researching a company and its staff to
      the nth degree, in case I share commonalities with anyone (same college,
      same neighborhood, same interests, etc.). I study everything on the
      website, Google everyone in the company, check LinkedIn for bios, etc. I
      write to the person I think is the right person or department I’d like to
      work for/in; if I’m not sure, I call and ask the operator or
      receptionist! You’d be surprised how friendly some people are; sometimes
      I’m put through to the right person without even asking. (Have a pitch
      prepared in case that happens to you!) That’s how I’ve gotten several
      jobs in different fields. HR is just a stumbling block. Sure, fill out
      the ridiculous online application that won’t let you skip steps that
      reveal your age, or put in any information that doesn’t fit its format,
      that scrambles your resume when you upload it, or picks out keywords to
      insert in some box that makes it look like you’re on drugs. Example: I
      was SO perfectly qualified for a particular job, heard nothing from HR,
      so I did my research, then wrote to the three people with whom I had
      something in common, and who would recognize the abilities and
      achievements on my resume. I got three responses, and the job. Still
      never heard from HR! On the flip side, the one time I did get a job by
      going through HR, it turned out to be a nightmare. Go directly to the
      source! If you can’t figure out who the right person is, send your
      material to the top few people. The worst that can happen is nothing;
      more likely, they’ll bump your info down the line to the right person–who
      will be more inclined to contact you, rather than risk pissing off the
      boss. Right now I’m starting another such campaign, prospecting for
      writing work.

      Very interesting…but how does a person that works as administrative
      assistant or helpdesk call center apply this technique?

      I like this idea. Funnily enough, it is actually exactly what I did when
      applying for an internal promotion a few weeks ago in response to the
      request for a cover letter. Disappointingly though my dragon slaying tale
      mustn’t have been good enough, they didn’t even interview and instead
      gave the job directly to someone who admittedly is older than me but has
      nowhere near the breadth of relevant industry experience. Ah well,
      learning experience.

      Hello Liz.
      Thank you SO much for this. It makes a lot of sense to work this way.
      However, as an MBA transitioning to another position within the same
      industry (visualizer to strategy), how would you propose that I write a
      Pain letter, seeing as I have no formal experience in the new position I
      want?

            Then it seems to me a Pain Letter would be perfect for you, since
            you can make a comparison to your desired position, from your
            previous experience; then work in how you slayed your Dragon.
